# Predicting Credit Risk with Supervised-ML

Build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

## Background

In the realm of lending services, companies offer opportunities for individual investors to partially finance personal loans and engage in the buying and selling of notes tied to these loans on a secondary market.

Leveraging this dataset, the task at hand involves constructing machine learning models to categorize the risk associated with specific loans. More precisely, the focus will be on comparing the efficacy of the Logistic Regression model against the Random Forest Classifier.

## Instructions

### Retrieve the data

The data is located in file.

* `lending_data.csv`

Import the data using Pandas.

## Consider the models

Create and compare two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before creating, fitting, and scoring the models, predict which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! Write down (in markdown cells in your Jupyter Notebook) your prediction, and justify your educated guess.

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. Choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.
